- First-class support for quantities with units
    - The fundamental type to support units is the quantity
    - Numeric literals may have optional unit suffixes whose type is a quantity with the specified units
    - The results of operations on quantities will have to correct units 
    - Strong type checking is performed; operations on quantities must have compatabile units
        - Assigning a quantity to a variable requires that the units be compatable as well
    - All commonly used units are predefined 
    - It is possible to obtain the magnitude and units of a quantity

    Examples
        1. let dist = 1_m;
        2. dist += 5_m 
        3. let speed = dist / 6_s; //Speed is equal to 1 m/s

- Nikola uses a separation compilation model where a module represents a translation unit

export let class foo : template<type T>;
export let class foo(int);
